# Binary to Decimal Converter
Simple Ruby program to convert decimal numbers to binary and vice versa.

This is a really simple Ruby program you can use to convert integers between decimal (base-10) and binary (base-2). 

Not responsible for inaccuracies, but I did my best to make this simple and reliable.
